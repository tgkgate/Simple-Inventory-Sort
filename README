	This mod automatically sorts the inventory of many types of blocks on any ship or station. This allows you to easily control what goes in and out of the inventory of each block on your ship or station.

	Any block that has an inventory can now pull inventory from other blocks that has inventory. Please be aware that _any_ block is now a target to have it's inventory pulled. Use [exempt] if you want the block to be safe from having it's inventory pulled.

	NOTE: To ensure special blocks that have built in sort do not pull inventory they aren't setup to pull, make sure that their "Use Conveyor System" option set to "Off". This will turn off default sorting on those blocks (For example, refineries, assemblers, connectors, etc)

	In order to setup a block, you set the name of a block to contain the type of item you want it to pull from other cargo holds. You enclose that item name in square brackets or round brackets (Use the '[]' brackets or the '()' brackets). If you want to do multiple sort operations , just comma separate the types. Operators can be applied to each sort as well. See examples below.

	NOTE:
	This mod should work for single player, multiplayer and dedicated servers!

	CURRENT SHARE LIMITATIONS:
	Currently, you may only sort cargo between holds you own directly unless you use the /sort faction chat command.

	OPERATORS:
	Beyond just sorting types of inventory, you can apply operators to sorts to do different things.

	Exempt Operator:
	Format is simply: [Exempt]. This tag makes it so that this block is exempt from pulls. Other blocks can not pull from it no matter what (including priority).

	Ignore Operator:
	Format is 'Item:Ignore' for example [SteelPlate:Ignore]. This tag allows the block to ignores steel plates when pulling inventory. Useful when you use it with wildcards, for example [Component,SteelPlate:Ignore] pulls all building components except steel plates.

	The following operators can be combined: (Separate each operator with a ':' character)
	Max Amount Operator:
	Format is 'Item:Amount' for example [SteelPlate:10000]. This tag allows the block to only pull 10000 steel plates and then stops pulling. This allows very precise amounts to be pulled into a block.

	Split Operator:
	Format is 'Item:Split' for example [SteelPlate:Split]. This tag allows the block to pull steel plates, but also splits them between other blocks that also have Item:Split defined. This will allow sharing of items between blocks.

	Priority Operator:
	Format is 'Item:PX' where X is a number for example: [SteelPlate:P1]. This tag allows a block to pull steel plates from anywhere, including other blocks that have steelplates defined as a sort option provided it's priority is higher than the other block. A block without a priority is considered to have the lowest priority. 1 is the highest priority.

	Override Operator:
	Format is "Item:Override" for example [Component:100,SteelPlate:Override:200]. This tag when used with wildcards will override the wildcard when applying operators. With the above example, the cargo hold will pull 100 of any component, but it will pull 200 steelplate.

	EXAMPLES:

	Name a cargo hold:
	Small: [Computer,SteelPlate]
	This cargo hold will pull computers and steel plates from other cargo holds.

	Name a cargo hold:
	Small: [Ore]
	This cargo hold will pull ANY type of ore it can from any cargo hold on the grid.

	Name a cargo hold:
	Small: [Ingot]
	This cargo hold will pull ANY type of ingot it can from any other cargo hold on the grid.

	Name a cargo hold:
	Example: [Component,SteelPlate:Ignore]
	This cargo hold will pull ANY building components EXCEPT SteelPlate

	Name a cargo hold:
	Example: [SteelPlate:10000]
	This cargo hold will pull 10000 steel plates max.

	Name two cargo holds:
	Example: [Component:Split]
	These two cargo holds will split components between one another. Please note this isn't an active split, it only splits on time of pull. They don't try to "equalize" each other, but they try to pull the same amount.

	Name a cargo hold:
	Example: [Component:P10]
	This makes the cargo hold pull any component, even if there are other cargo holds also with the Component tag. This cargo hold has a priority of 10.

	Name two cargo holds:
	Example: [Component:P10:Split:10000]
	This makes two cargo holds that pull components evenly between each other, and gives them a priority of 10. They also only pull a max of 10,000 components each.

	Name a cargo hold:
	Example: [Exempt]
	Makes cargo hold exempt from having inventory taken.

	Current Chat Commands:
	/sort toggle - this command toggles the automated sorting off or on.
	/sort faction - this command toggles sorting of shared blocks. This starts OFF, so if you'd like to sort faction shared blocks, toggle this once.
	/sort debug - this command gives timing information on sorts. Used to help track down performance problems.

	Recent Updates:
	v0.1.0.13
	Milestone update. I've gotten the mod about as close to completed as I wanted. There are a few small changes and some operators I want to add, but this update is finally where I wanted it to be from the start.
	- All blocks that have inventories are now valid targets as a puller and a pullee. Any block in the game that has an inventory can now use the sort mod. I always wanted this implemented, but wanted to expand slowly to make sure I didn't miss any bugs with different types of blocks.
	- Added the ability to sort through advanced rotors.

	List of valid wildcards:
	Ammo - Pulls all types of ammo
	Component - Pulls all building components
	Ore - Pulls all raw ore
	Ingot - Pulls all Ingots
	PhysicalGunObject - Pulls drills, grinders, guns, welders
	Iron - Pulls both Iron ingots and Iron ore (replace Iron with any type of material)

	List of valid sort types:
	NATO_5p56x45mm
	NATO_25x184mm
	Missile200mm
	Ore/Stone
	Ore/Iron
	Ore/Nickel
	Ore/Cobalt
	Ore/Magnesium

	Construction
	MetalGrid
	InteriorPlate
	SteelPlate
	Girder
	SmallTube
	LargeTube
	Motor
	Display
	BulletproofGlass
	Computer

	PROBLEMS:
	Having issues or problems? Starting a discussion is the easiest way to try to get things handled. I try to address problems as best as I can, as finding and fixing bugs helps everyone. There is a log file in %appdata%/spaceengineers/storage/321588701.sbm_SimpleInventorySort that allows me to see some debug of your sorting. If you type /sort debug when having issues, this also helps me track things down even more before sending me a log. If you are crashing or believe it's my mod causing the crashes, a copy of your spaceengineers.log will help, though a lot of the time crashes in the game are game related and not the mod. Please put all logs on pastebin.com and post the link in a discussion and I can look through and figure it out.

	Please note: There is no "Gravel" type, as it's not in the definition files as Gravel, but as a Stone Ingot. If you're having issue sorting gravel, try Ingot/Stone instead.
